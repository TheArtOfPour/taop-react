# taop-react
Frontend react code for https://theartofpour.com

Thank you to everyone who attended my talk at this year's HomebrewCon.

I'll be working over the next few days on getting any remaining code/data deployed, as well as setting licenses and documentation.

Cheers!

This project relies on [taop-api](https://github.com/TheArtOfPour/taop-api) running @ http://127.0.0.1:5000

This url is configurable through the .env file (REACT_APP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000)

Installing: 

```npm install``` (This can take a while...)

Running:

```npm start```


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
